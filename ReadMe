This program comes from a Java program I wrote over the summer for my job at HiQ Labs.
It scrapes Google's search results using Nokogiri to grab both the names and public LinkedIn urls of a specific company's employees.  

The Ruby version is much more concise.

The Java is my first piece of ~production code~ so it is more of a momento than functional (try to read it)
