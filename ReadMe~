This program comes from a Java program I wrote over the summer for my job at HiQ Labs.
It scrapes Google's search results using Nokogiri to grab both the names and public LinkedIn urls of a specific company's employees.  

The Ruby version is much more concise and makes a lot more sense at first glance.  My implementation of JSoup is very messy and Iâ€™m happy to see how easy scraping is in Ruby.
